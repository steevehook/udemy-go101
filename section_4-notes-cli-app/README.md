# Section 4 - Note CLI app

## Overview

In this section we'll develop a CLI application from scratch using
everything we have learnt in previous 3 sections.

We're gonna build a Notes CLI application, capable of creating,
reading, updating and deleting a note.

By the end of this section you'll be confident in building CLI apps in
Go and have practiced everything we have learnt about the Language Basics.
Grab your keyboard and let's build something amazing ðŸ’»
